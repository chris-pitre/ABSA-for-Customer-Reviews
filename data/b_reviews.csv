"I've been drinking this particular soda for as long as I can remember. It's the kind of drink that seems to define what a classic soda should taste like. The consistency in flavor from bottle to bottle is impressive, and the aftertaste is just right not too sweet, not too bitter. However, the high calorie and sugar content is becoming a bigger issue for me as I try to adopt a healthier lifestyle. While I enjoy the taste and the nostalgia it brings, I'm increasingly looking for alternatives that offer a similar experience without the health drawbacks. The packaging is a positive aspect, though, as it's clear the company has put thought into environmental impact.","taste, aftertaste, packaging",calories
