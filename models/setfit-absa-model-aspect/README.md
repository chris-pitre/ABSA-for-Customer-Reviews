# SetFit Aspect Model with sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2

This is a [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) model that can be used for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). This SetFit model uses [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2) as the Sentence Transformer embedding model. A [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) instance is used for classification. In particular, this model is in charge of filtering aspect span candidates.

The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

This model was trained within the context of a larger system for ABSA, which looks like so:

1. Use a spaCy model to select possible aspect span candidates.
2. **Use this SetFit model to filter these possible aspect span candidates.**
3. Use a SetFit model to classify the filtered aspect span candidates.

## Uses

### Direct Use for Inference

First install the SetFit library:

```bash
pip install setfit
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.

```python
from setfit import AbsaModel

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = AbsaModel.from_pretrained(
    "/content/drive/MyDrive/ABSA/models/setfit-absa-model-aspect",
    "/content/drive/MyDrive/ABSA/models/setfit-absa-model-polarity",
)
# Run inference
preds = model("The food was great, but the venue is just way too busy.")
```
