# SetFit Polarity Model with sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2

This is a [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) model that can be used for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). This SetFit model uses [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2) as the Sentence Transformer embedding model. A [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) instance is used for classification. In particular, this model is in charge of classifying aspect polarities.

The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

This model was trained within the context of a larger system for ABSA, which looks like so:

1. Use a spaCy model to select possible aspect span candidates.
2. Use a SetFit model to filter these possible aspect span candidates.
3. **Use this SetFit model to classify the filtered aspect span candidates.**
